# Learning_Git_Commands
It is first time to use Git hub so practicing the git commands . You can see my commands in readme may be useful for beginners to use git commands.
Install Git bash in windows for better learning and practice 
The basic commands are : 
1.) init : It should be the 1st command . Beacuse it will helps to track the project folder . When you clone a project folder from git hub .git folder will be created to track the project (You can check by ls-a command.) by .git the file will be tracked.
