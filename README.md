# Learning_Git_Commands
It is first time to use Git hub so practicing the git commands . You can see my commands in readme may be useful for beginners to use git commands.
Install Git bash in windows for better learning and practice
The basic commands are : 
<br>
1.) init : It should be the 1st command . Beacuse it will helps to track the project folder . When you clone a project folder from git hub .git folder will be created to track the project (You can check by ls-a command.) by .git the file will be tracked.
2.) clone : git clone <url> the url can be https or ssh link. Generally we copy https links to clone the git hub repos but you can also use ssh.
Generally ssh are used for accessing servers securely . But in git hub by using ssh link to clone the repos , they use some kind of keys i think so and i didnt event tried yet , May be i try in the future theni will commit this.
